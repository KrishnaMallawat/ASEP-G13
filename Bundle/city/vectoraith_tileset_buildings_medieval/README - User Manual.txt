Introduction

Thank you for purchasing VectoRaith's Generic Medieval Buildings Tileset Pack!
The pack contains 16x16 px tilesets and 2 different resizes: (32x32 and 48x48 px)
Each resize is placed in their respective folder for convenience.
There is also an animated, 3-frames fountain sprite included.


In this pack, there are 3 main contents:

1. Main Tileset

Main tileset refers to main asset intended to be sold independently for this pack (i.e: vectoraith_tileset_16x16_buildings_wooden_1.png, vectoraith_tileset_16x16_buildings_wooden_2. png, etc.). In most case, main tileset does not require special set up . What you need is only set the tile size, set the collision, then start to placing the tiles into the map.

2. Autotiles

Autotiles are tiles specifically made for certain engines that support "auto-tiling". Every autotiles in my release is always a rare and special case, you can always regard it as "free demo" prior to final release. Engine I currently supported is RPG Maker series (sans RPG Maker XP) 

3. Sprites

Sprites are animated pixel art corresponding to specific tiles. There are two types of Sprites in my creations: 1. Objects and 2.Characters. Objects always have !$ in their start of filename and set up for 3 frames. Each row represents one facing direction (down, left, right, and up), but can be exploited to represents one kind of object. Characters are always released in 8-character spritesheet format unless under special circumstances.



How to Use

Tileset usage and set up depend heavily on the game engine used. Due to incredible amount of tileset mapping engines available, please refer to tileset set up tutorial for each engine.

Main tileset PNGs are compatible with all if not most engines, e.g. RPG Maker, Godot, Unity, Tiled, etc.

Bonus autotile pack is currently only tested and compatible for:

RPG Maker VX and VX Ace (32x32 px)
RPG Maker MV (48x48 px)
RPG Maker MZ (all sizes)
Keep in mind that only RPG Maker XP and MZ that support transparent Wall and other autotiles

If you want to use Tiled for auto-tiling, due to current incompatibility, of course the autotileset need to be adjusted manually (please see https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/auto-tiles-in-tiled-parallax-ma... for editing  reference)



Swappability

By default, assets in this pack will be always swap-compatible for other VectoRaith's Buildings series.
You just need to match the last number written in their filename. Examples:

vectoraith_tileset_16x16_buildings_wooden_1.png is always swappable with vectoraith_tileset_16x16_buildings_modern_1. png. 
vectoraith_tileset_16x16_buildings_wooden_2.png is always swappable with vectoraith_tileset_16x16_buildings_modern_2. png. 

Please refer to their respective filename and layout when swapping.

>> v1.01- Added Building 3 set, slightly adjusting the style for consistency and partial modularity, added red buildings variants for Building 1 set
